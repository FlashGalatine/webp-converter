## What's New in v2.1

### üéØ Adaptive Anti-Aliasing
Professional-grade image quality improvements for downsampling:
- **Automatic Quality Control**: Intelligent pre-filtering prevents oversharpening artifacts
- **Gaussian Pre-Filter**: Applies optimal blur before resampling based on downsampling ratio
- **No Configuration Needed**: Works automatically - you'll see "Applying anti-aliasing..." when active
- **Smart Detection**: Only applies for significant downsampling (< 67% scale)
- **Better Results**: Eliminates ringing, halos, and moir√© patterns that occur with bicubic/Lanczos

**Technical Details:**
- Prevents oversharpening that naturally occurs with bicubic and Lanczos interpolation
- Uses Nyquist frequency-based blur radius calculation
- Two-pass separable Gaussian blur for efficiency
- Formula: `blurRadius = (1.0 / scale - 1.0) * 0.5`
- Examples:
  - 4K ‚Üí 1080p (4x downsample): radius ‚âà 1.5
  - 1080p ‚Üí 720p (1.5x downsample): radius ‚âà 0.25

**When It Works:**
- Applies to: Bicubic, Lanczos, and Bilinear resampling methods
- Skipped for: Nearest Neighbor and Browser Default methods
- Only active when downsampling significantly (reducing by more than 33%)

## What's New in v2.0

### üéâ Image Queue System
- **Batch Processing**: Load and process multiple images at once
- **Multi-file Selection**: Select multiple files or drag & drop entire folders
- **Visual Queue Panel**: See all queued images with status indicators
- **Progress Tracking**: Track which images have been processed (‚úì)
- **Auto-advance**: Automatically move to next image after conversion
- **Remove After Convert**: Option to auto-remove images from queue after processing
- **Navigation**: Previous/Next buttons and click-to-load functionality

### üé® Advanced Resampling Methods
Choose the best resampling algorithm for your needs when resizing images:
- **Lanczos**: Highest quality, best for downscaling (slower)
- **Bicubic**: Recommended default, excellent quality/speed balance
- **Bilinear**: Fast with smooth results
- **Nearest Neighbor**: Fastest, preserves hard edges (ideal for pixel art)
- **Browser Default**: Native browser resampling

### ‚ö° Smart Auto-Features
- **Auto Zoom to Fit**: Images automatically fit the canvas on load
- **Auto-load Presets**: Automatically loads `presets.json` if present in the same folder
- **Smart Preset Selection**: Auto-selects appropriate preset based on image dimensions (Square/Landscape/Portrait)

### üéØ Custom Preset System
- Load custom presets from JSON files
- Switch between built-in and custom presets at any time
- Automatic application of preset-specific settings
- Platform-specific presets (BlueSky, Twitter, Discord, etc.)

### Preset-Specific Settings
When using custom presets, the following settings are automatically applied:
- **Max Width/Height**: Automatically constrains output dimensions
- **Target File Size**: Automatically enables web optimization with specified target size
- **Crop Ratio**: Sets the aspect ratio for cropping
- **Default Selection**: Auto-selects preset based on image orientation

## How to Use

### Quick Start
1. Open `index.html` (STABLE) or `webp-converter-web-EXPERIMENTAL.html` (EXPERIMENTAL)
2. Load an image (or multiple images for batch processing)
3. Select a crop preset or use freestyle
4. Adjust quality settings and resampling method
5. Click "Convert & Download"

### Using the Image Queue System
**Loading Multiple Images:**
- **Method 1**: Click "Select Image(s)" and hold Ctrl/Cmd to select multiple files
- **Method 2**: Drag and drop multiple images onto the canvas

**Queue Controls:**
- **Previous/Next**: Navigate between queued images
- **Click Image**: Jump to any image in the queue
- **Remove (‚úï)**: Remove individual images from queue
- **Clear All**: Clear entire queue
- **Remove After Convert**: Enable to auto-remove images after processing

**Status Indicators:**
- **‚ñ∂** = Currently active image (amber background)
- **‚úì** = Already processed/converted (green checkmark)

### Choosing a Resampling Method
When resizing images (using Max Width/Height), select the appropriate resampling method:

- **Lanczos** - Best for photographs and high-quality downscaling (with anti-aliasing)
- **Bicubic** - Good all-around choice, recommended default (with anti-aliasing)
- **Bilinear** - Faster processing with acceptable quality (with anti-aliasing)
- **Nearest Neighbor** - Use for pixel art or when you want sharp edges (no anti-aliasing)
- **Browser Default** - Let the browser handle resampling (no anti-aliasing)

*Note: Resampling only applies when the output dimensions differ from the crop dimensions. Anti-aliasing is automatically applied for Lanczos, Bicubic, and Bilinear when significantly downsampling.*

### Loading Custom Presets
1. Click the **"Load Custom Presets"** button in the "Preset Source" section
2. Select your JSON preset file (e.g., `presets.json`)
3. The app will load all presets from the file

### Switching Between Presets
- Once loaded, custom presets appear in the **"Crop Preset"** dropdown
- An info panel shows preset-specific settings (if any) for the selected preset
- Click **"Use Built-in"** to switch back to built-in presets
- Click **"Load Different"** to load a different custom preset file

### Preset Information
When a custom preset is selected, you'll see an amber-colored info panel showing:
- Max width constraint (if specified)
- Max height constraint (if specified)
- Target file size (if specified)

## JSON Format

Your JSON preset file should follow this format:

```json
{
  "Preset Name": {
    "max-width": 1000,
    "max-height": 2000,
    "max-filesize": 1,
    "max-filesize-unit": "MB",
    "crop-ratio": 0.5,
    "default-selection": "Landscape"
  }
}
```

### Available Properties
- `max-width`: Maximum width in pixels (optional)
- `max-height`: Maximum height in pixels (optional)
- `max-filesize`: Target file size value (optional)
- `max-filesize-unit`: Unit for file size - "KB", "MB", or "GB" (default: "MB")
- `crop-ratio`: Aspect ratio (width/height) for cropping (optional, null = freestyle)
- `default-selection`: Auto-select trigger - "Square", "Landscape", or "Portrait" (optional)

## Tips & Best Practices

### Image Quality (NEW in v2.1)
- **Anti-aliasing works automatically** - no configuration needed
- For high-quality downsampling: Use **Lanczos** or **Bicubic** with anti-aliasing (default)
- Downsampling 4K to 1080p? Anti-aliasing prevents oversharpening and ringing artifacts
- Want pixel-perfect sharp edges? Use **Nearest Neighbor** (skips anti-aliasing)

### Performance
- For batch processing large images, use "Auto Zoom to Fit" and "Remove After Convert" for faster workflow
- Lanczos resampling is slower but produces the best quality for downscaling
- Use Nearest Neighbor for pixel art to preserve sharp edges
- Anti-aliasing adds minimal overhead (only applies when needed)

### Presets
- Place `presets.json` in the same folder as the converter for automatic loading
- Use `default-selection` to auto-select presets based on image orientation
- Custom presets override manual settings for max dimensions and target file size
- You can still manually adjust quality and lossless settings after preset selection
- The crop can be adjusted manually on the canvas even with presets

### Workflow
- Process similar images in batch using the queue system with the same settings
- Use "Optimize for Web" to hit specific file size targets
- Combine resampling methods with quality settings for optimal results
- Navigate queue with Previous/Next buttons or click images directly
- Watch for "Applying anti-aliasing..." status message during significant downsampling

### File Management
- Converted files are named with date, resolution, and quality: `image-2025-10-26-1920x1080px-q95.webp`
- Lossless files are marked with `qLL` in the filename
- No data leaves your computer - all processing is client-side
