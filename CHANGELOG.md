## Version History

### v2.6.1-STABLE (November 9, 2025)
**Bug Fixes & Code Quality Improvements**

**Bug Fixes:**
- **Fixed Auto-Load Presets Bug** - Aspect ratios from JSON presets now properly parse string formats like "16/9", "4/3" (was only handling numeric decimal values)
  - Uses `parseAspectRatio()` function which supports both formats
  - Enables custom presets with ratio notation to work correctly

- **Fixed Lanczos Resampling Error** - Resolved `ReferenceError: a is not defined` when using Lanczos resampling with certain presets
  - All references to `a` variable in loop bounds now use `LANCZOS_WINDOW_SIZE` constant
  - Prevents crashes during high-quality image downsampling

- **Fixed Blob URL Memory Leak** - Download cleanup now delayed to ensure completion
  - Changed `URL.revokeObjectURL(url)` to `setTimeout(() => URL.revokeObjectURL(url), 100)`
  - Prevents premature URL revocation that could interrupt downloads

**Error Handling & Robustness:**
- Added comprehensive error handlers for image loading
  - `loadImage()` now has try-catch wrapper
  - Image decode errors caught with `img.onerror` handler
  - File read errors caught with `reader.onerror` handler

- Added division-by-zero guards in dimension calculations
  - Max width/height constraints now verify dimensions are > 0 before division
  - Prevents NaN values in resampling operations

**Performance Optimizations:**
- **Memoized Preset Selection** - `getCurrentPresets()` now uses `useMemo` hook
  - Eliminates unnecessary recalculation on every render
  - Only recalculates when `useCustomPresets` or `customPresets` changes

- **Improved React Imports** - Added `useMemo` and `useCallback` for future optimizations
  - Allows for more sophisticated performance improvements
  - Prepares codebase for event handler memoization

**Code Quality Improvements:**
- **Eliminated Magic Numbers** - Created 16 named constants for better maintainability
  - UI Constants: CANVAS_PADDING, CROP_HANDLE_SIZE, HANDLE_TOLERANCE, MIN_CROP_SIZE, ZOOM_MIN, ZOOM_MAX, ZOOM_INITIAL_DELAY, TRANSITION_DELAY
  - Image Processing: MIN_BLUR_RADIUS, BLUR_THRESHOLD, GAUSSIAN_KERNEL_MULTIPLIER, LANCZOS_WINDOW_SIZE, SIGNIFICANT_DOWNSAMPLE_THRESHOLD, ASPECT_RATIO_TOLERANCE
  - Cursor Map: CURSOR_MAP object

- **Removed Code Duplication** - Consolidated queue handling logic
  - Created `handlePostConversionQueue()` helper function
  - Replaced 3 duplicate instances of queue management (lossless, quality-optimized, and default conversion paths)
  - Single source of truth for post-conversion behavior

- **Centralized Cursor Styling** - Unified cursor map into global constant
  - Removed 2 duplicate CURSOR_MAP definitions
  - Saved 40+ lines of duplicate code
  - Single reference for all cursor type mappings

- **Consistent Naming Conventions** - Standardized throughout codebase
  - Event handlers follow `handle*` pattern
  - State getters follow `get*` pattern
  - Boolean checks follow `is*` pattern

**Accessibility Improvements:**
- **Canvas ARIA Labels** - Added dynamic accessibility descriptions
  - Shows current crop dimensions and zoom level
  - Updates in real-time for screen readers
  - Improves experience for users with assistive technologies

**Testing:**
- All features tested with built-in and custom presets
